<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Ocean Technology and EngineeringÂ at [zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), working under the mentorship of [Professor Jiawang Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiawang-Chen), [Professor Yuan Lin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/linyuan#0), and [Professor Peiliang Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lipeiliang#0). My research focuses on the following aspects of ocean engineering: pipeline engineering, gas hydrates, soft robotic fish, offshore geotechnical engineering, and rheology, with a special focus on the external inspection of subsea pipelines and pipe-soil interaction.
## Research Interest:
- **Pipeline engineering:** external pipeline inspection, in-line inspection(ILI), in-situ pipeline repair, underwater habitat, 3D structured light mapping, pipe-soil interaction.
- **Gas hydrates:** pressure-maintain and transfer of hydrate samples, high-fidelity cutting technology for hydrate samples, CO2 Capture.
- **Soft robotic fish** soft matter mechanics, smart material & structures, underwater equipment, artificial muscle.
- **Offshore geotechnical engineering** cone penetration test (CPT), dynamic penetration test (DPT), submarine topography monitoring technology(based MEMS), stratum-drilling robots, electromagnetic emission(EME).
- **AUV** FSI(fluid-structure interaction), navigation, underwater vision, underwater structures mapping based on AUV(e.g. subsea pipelines).
- **Rheology** rheology of multiphase flow, clay rheology.
