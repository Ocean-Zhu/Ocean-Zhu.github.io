    project: The safety of submarine pipelines is crucial to offshore oil and gas operations. This study developed an unmanned submarine light-scanning mapping system that combines structured light technology with a large-scale underwater dry chamber, enabling precise in-situ external pipeline inspection in the high-turbidity condition. A sophisticated structured light scanning driving system(SLSDS) for precise motion control of the structured-light scanner is designed, combined with the motor synchronous drive technology and tailored strategies for pipeline mapping, leading to a seamless full scan in a single deployment. In addition, a shipboard electric control subsystem(SECS) is set up to provide an integrated solution for power supply, sensing, communication, and control. The proposed dry-cabin mapping system has been successfully applied in the Zhoushan sea area offshore, demonstrating its potential to be widely used in the offshore area with poor-visibility underwater conditions. China Natural Resources Daily reported the project.
