  - title: Defects of Subsea Pipelines Mapping Based 3D Structured Light and Subsea Habitat.
    authors: Zhu Hai
    project_short: Subsea Pipeline Engineering
    project: The safety of submarine pipelines is crucial to offshore oil and gas operations. This study developed an unmanned submarine light-scanning mapping system that combines structured light technology with a large-scale underwater habitat, enabling precise in-situ external pipeline inspection in the high-turbidity condition. China Natural Resources Daily reported the project.
